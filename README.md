Retro Rush was initially coding in python using the Pygame library before being converted to binary wasm (WebAssembly) with the asyncio library and Pygbag. Levels were designed in Tiled and sprites from Kenny were texture packed with CodeAndWeb. Credit to CDcodes and his Pygame Tile Based Game Tutorial for the Initial Physics, Collisions, Tile mapping, and Spritesheet code for this game. Background Music was made by me with Bandlab.
